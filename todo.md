# [x] first analysis

I'm using this file to brainstorm about this web progressive app I want to build in order to improve my learning in React, solidy the concepts I studied so far and to get some practice experience.

Ideally, this project should use

- redux + react-redux for state management
- react-roture to have multiple pages, let's say at least 2 so that I can show I can use router
- i should draw at least the screens
  - for each screen i should draw the single components
  - for each components, there should be a few notes about main functinoalityu and state that will have, based on user interaction
- this application must have at least a couple of unit tests
- another thing is that it must be progressive, which means that a manifest is needed and a service worker as well. I think cra comes in handy for that
- code should be splitted accordingly
- there should be a user management functionality. Meaning:
  - a new user can register
  - a registered user can login
  - user goal states are saved accordingly on backend
  - everytime a user login he is redirected to main page
- there should be more pages - homepage: - intro message - button to go to goals page - wip area - button to register - buttoi to login - this page should have - header
  - logo - on the right -> login button - goals page - add a task section - a "+" button to toggle - when i click the + btn - a popup shows up on the page. this popup contains a small form that enable the user to add a task and set the amout of times per wekk that he wants to reach this goal - goal list - goal tracker component - goal tracker component - goal tracker component - [...] - goal tracker component. How is it composed. It should have: - goal name - goal score - goal total amount of times planned for meeting in a week - an edit button. this button when clicked - opens up the goal setting popup, where user can - edit goal name - edit goal total number of times to meet in a week - a save button
    -> if clicked
    -> saves goal tracker state
    -> updates goal list state
    -> closes popup - a cancel button
    -> if clicked
    -> it closes the popup - a delete button
    -> when clicked
    -> delets this goal
    -> updates the goals total list - a "+1" button - if clicked -> increases goal current score by 1 - a "-1" button - if current score is 0 -> disable button - if clicked
    -> decreases goal current score by 1 - login page that is Armani-like, which means has - login form on the left - if on landing I detect that the user session is registered -> redirect to homepage - if user is not registered. then I show a landing with two sections - a section on the left showing a login form - a section on the right containing: - a text informing the user about registration benefits - a btn that when clicked, redirects the user to the registration page - register page - if on landing I detect that the user session is registered -> redirect to homepage - if user is not registered. then I show the registration form.

## [] main behavior

### [] frontend

#### [x] main logic and structuire

        [x] homepage
            [x] welcome message
            [x] cta to go to the goals page when clicked
            [x] cta to register (to add later when i develop the user management backend logic)
            [x] cta to login (to add later when i develop the user management backend logic)
        [x] goals page
            [x] goals list
                [x] state: goalsList
                    [x] set initial state
                    [x] print all initial goals on landing
                [x] user interactions
                    - onGoalIncrement -> setGoalsList +1
                    - onGoalDecrement -> setGoalsList by removing goal
            [x] goal tracker component
                - state:
                    - goalCount
                - key=uniqueId (da capire come renderlo unico se gli obiettivi li creo a mano, e non mi arrivano da un'api). L'importante Ã¨ che l'id non arrivi
                [x] add goal
                    [] click on button
                        [x] open add goal form
                    [x] compile form
                    [x] on form submit
                        [x] validation
                            [x] title must be text
                            [x] score must be a valid number
                            [x] id must be unique
                        [x] update goalsListState
                [x] put the form in a modal
                    [x] create a modal
                    x put the form in there
                    [x] on add goal btn click
                        [x] when modal state is open (true) -> show modal
                        [x] set modal state to open
                        [x] when modal state is not open (false) -> hide modal
                [x] goal score
                    [x] report times goal was met / total times the goas is supposed to be met
                    [x] increase score btn
                        [x] click -> increase score by 1 -> setGoalsCount(prevGoalsCount => prevGoalsCount + 1)
                        [x] fix bug: on increase first click doesn't fire
                    [x] decrease score btn
                        [x] click -> increase score by 1 -> setGoalsCount(prevGoalsCount => prevGoalsCount + 1)
                    [x] on goal max score reached: color goal card by green and disable
                [x] edit goal btn
                    [x] open edit form modal on edit button click
                    [x] when you open the form, form title and score input fields should be filled with data from that specific goal in the state
                    [x] edit of info inside input field is allowed
                    [x] submit
                        [x] goal title input field should still be of type text
                        [x] goal score input field should still be of type number
                        [x] in the state, we should update only the goal object that is directly interested (filtering done by matching goal unique id)
                    [x] page should now display the same number of goals
                    [x] page should now display the same number of goals in the same order
                    [x] page should now display the same number of goals in the same order and unique ids are not changed
                    [x] click and counter to increment should still work on same goal
                    [x] click and counter to increment should still work on same goal
                    [x] click and counter to increment should still work on other goals
                    [x] click and counter to increment should still work on other goals
                [x] delete goal btn
                    [x] clicking on this button should delete the matching goal item in global goals state array
                    [x] regression test on goal lists
            [x] landing: keep track of all the added goal, which means: persist goal data on page reload

    [] loader:
        [] while firestore operation is performing -> show loader
        [] while firestore operation is performing -> hide loader

# [] test

# [] migrate code to typeScrit

    [] migrate all of the code to TypeScript
    [] test that everything works accordingly
    [] push all the new codde

# [] check this error out when trying to edit goal max score

Warning: A component is changing a controlled input to be uncontrolled. This is likely caused by the value changing from a defined to undefined, which should not happen. Decide between using a controlled or uncontrolled input element for the lifetime

# [] cleanup

    [] remove console.logs
    [] remove firestore credentials from repo
    [] remove todo from commited file
